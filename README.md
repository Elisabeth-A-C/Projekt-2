# Projekt-2

## Introduction
In this project, we have created a program where the user can upload a comma-separated .csv file containing data for student grades. 
The .csv file needs to be complete, and it needs to contain the following information:

    StudentID, Name, Assignment 1, Assignment 2, Assignment 3, etc.

Where the number of Assignments needs to be at least 1, and the number of students needs to be at least one. The user can choose to load new data in the main menu.

In the main menu, the user can also choose to check the data for data errors (student duplicates),
